								<h2>Bio</h2>
							</header>
							<p>I'm <a class="blue" href="https://www.memphis.edu/philosophy/people/bios/salman-khawaja.php">Dr. Salman Khawaja</a>, a philosophy instructor at the University of Memphis and an aspiring game developer. I started <b>Reflective Thinking Games</b>, an educational gaming company, to develop educational games for high school and university students - and anyone else that wants to learn while playing entertaining games! <b>Disinfo Fighters</b> is the first game that I'm developing to respond to the challenges that students are facing with <b>online misinformation</b> and <b>conspiracy theories</b>. Since it is for a good cause, the game will be <b>free</b> for anyone who wants to learn. To keep the game free and to complete the development of the game, I hope you will <a class="blue" href ="https://disinfofighters.com/support-us.html">donate and be a supporter of the game</a>!</p>

							<h2>Disinfo Fighters Origin</h2>
								<span class="byline maroon">Only 26% of young adults are confident about verifying COVID-19 news accuracy.</span>
								<span class="maroon">-Pew Research Center, 2020</span>
							</header>
                            <p>Every semester, I increasingly noticed my <b>students struggling</b> with online misinformation and conspiracy theories. Everything from <b>COVID vaccine conspiracies</b> to <b>Holocaust denial</b> were showing up on discussion boards and essays.</p> 

                            <p>Disinfo Fighters expands on the strategies I'd use in the classroom to help my students, and it does it in a more engaging way! Players learn to <b>spot misinformation</b> and understand <b>science denial tactics</b>. They also develop their <b>critical thinking</b> and <b>debating skills</b> by tackling a real case study on measles vaccine disinformation in 2018 Samoa.</p>  

                            <p>Of course, this issue is not only limited to my students. We could <b>all</b> use more practice to sharpen our critical thinking skills and better evaluate online content. As games increasingly occupy our time, why not create ones that not only entertain us, but also help to respond to the most <b>urgent problems</b> we face today? I hope Disinfo Fighters can play a role in that.</p>

							<h2>Reflective Thinking Games' Goals</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The goal of Disinfo Fighters and future games that I'm planning to develop are to help train players in <b>critical thinking, media literacy, and science literacy</b>. The games will also try to respond to some of the urgent problems that we face today, such as helping us to better navigate our polluted information landscapes. The wider goal is to make educational games that are entertaining for a general audience.</p>
