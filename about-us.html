								<h2>Bio</h2>
							</header>
							<p>I'm <a class="blue" href="https://www.memphis.edu/philosophy/people/bios/salman-khawaja.php">Dr. Salman Khawaja</a>, a philosophy instructor at the University of Memphis and a game developer. I started <b>Reflective Thinking Games</b>, a gaming studio, to develop educational games for high school and university students - and anyone else that wants to learn while playing entertaining games!<br>
							<b>Disinfo Fighters</b> is the first game that I'm developing to respond to the challenges that students are facing with <b>online misinformation</b> and <b>conspiracy theories</b>. Since it is for a good cause, the game will be <b>free</b> for anyone who wants to learn. To keep the game free and to complete the development of the game, your help is needed to <b>fund</b> the game. I hope you will be a <a class="blue" href ="support-us.html">supporter of the game</a>!</p>

								<span class="byline maroon">Only 26% of young adults are confident about verifying COVID-19 news accuracy.</span>
								<span class="maroon">-Pew Research Center, 2020</span>
							</header>
							<p>As a philosophy instructor, I have been increasingly seeing my students struggling with <b>online misinformation and conspiracy theories</b>. Every semester, it would come up more frequently in class discussions and in their essays.<br>
							Of course, this problem is not just limited to my students. We could all use more practice to sharpen our critical thinking skills and to better evaluate online information. I'm developing <b>Disinfo Fighters</b> to achieve these educational goals. Games are increasingly occupying our time. Why not have more games that not only entertain us, but also improve our thinking habits to address the most urgent problems that we face today? </p>

							<h2>Reflective Thinking Games' Goals</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The goal of Disinfo Fighters and future games that I'm planning to develop are to help train students in <b>critical thinking, media, and science literacy</b>. The games created by Reflective Thinking Games, will aim to help students to navigate the polluted information landscape that they face today. The wider goal is to make educational games that are entertaining for a general audience.</p>
